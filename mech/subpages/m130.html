      <p class="description">
       A mass with a horizontal pin attached hangs from a vertical spiral spring. A disc with its plane vertical, bearing a horizontal pin at its circumference, is driven by a motor. Shadows of the two pins are cast by a 12V “point source” lamp onto a wall. Adjust the speed of the motor to equalise the two frequencies. Pull the mass down so that its amplitude is the same as that of the motor-driven pin's shadow and try to release it so that the two shadow pins oscillate up and down in phase.
