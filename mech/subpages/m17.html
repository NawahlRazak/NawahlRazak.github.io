      <p class="description">
        A lamina is mounted with its plane vertical. It can be suspended from various points around its periphery. A thread with a mass attached hangs from the lamina’s point of suspension and indicates the “central lines” of mass. All the lines intersect at the centre of gravity of the lamina. If the lamina is suspended by a horizontal pin through its centre of gravity, all positions are stable. If it is suspended from one the peripheral points, it will always hang so that its centre of mass is directly below that point.
