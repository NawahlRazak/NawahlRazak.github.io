      <p class="description">
       This consists of two rods that are able to move freely. One has a small mass attached to its lower end. If both pendulums are held horizontally and released simultaneously from rest, the pendulum without a mass attached accelerates faster and reaches the bottom first. This can be a rather tricky question (of which will reach the bottom first), requiring careful analysis by the student.
