       This is on a trolley, and is kept in prep room A. Elastic collisions may be demonstrated. Another interesting demonstration: A wooden dowel with its centre of mass marked is held vertically with the bottom end supported by a very light air table puck. When it is released and allowed to topple, which point of the stick will be directly above the original support point: the top end, the bottom end, or the centre of mass? Note that the stick has a small counterweight on its top end to compensate for the mass of the puck.
