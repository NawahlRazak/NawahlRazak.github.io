        This requires a tall stand with a ruler attached and a length of No. 20 gauge bare copper wire (or a rubber band). Load and unload the wire with several masses. Show that the extension is proportional to the load and that this is also (approximately) reversible. Then load the wire with lots of kilogram masses and show that the wire begins to run irreversibly. (We say that it passes its elastic limit or yield point.)
