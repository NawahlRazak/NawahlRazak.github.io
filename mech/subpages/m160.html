      <p class="description">
       A Wilberforce pendulum consists of a cylindrical bob on a spring. The cylinder has vertical lines drawn on it so that you can clearly see how it is rotating. A Wilberforce pendulum has two normal modes: (1) the bob rotates clockwise while it is moving down, and (2) the bob rotates counter clockwise while it is moving down. If the bob is pulled down but not rotated, the system is regarded as being started in a combination of both modes. It will therefore oscillate between the two normal modes with some characteristic beat frequency. A much smaller Wilberforce pendulum is also available.
