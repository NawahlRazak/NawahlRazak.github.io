      <p class="description">
       Air is compressed in the rocket by means of the pump; when the air is released, the rocket rises by a small amount. If a small amount of water is poured into the air compartment from the squeeze bottle pictured at the right and air compressed in the rocket to the same pressure as before, the rocket will rise very high when released. Due to its greater mass, the water exhaust has more momentum than the air; thus more reaction force is applied to the rocket by the exhausting water. Best done indoors in a packed lecture theatre.
