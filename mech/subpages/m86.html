      <p class="description">
       To demonstrate elastic collisions, bounce a half-inch steel ball on a hardened steel block. You could also use a three-quarter inch glass marble; which is at least as elastic. A perspex tube serves to restrain the ball from flying off sideways. To show inelastic collisions, drop the ball onto a thin metal plate held in your fingers; or onto a sink drainage cover; or use a blob of putty instead of a steel ball.
