      <p class="description">
        As the sphere rolls down, its potential energy (due to its height) is converted into kinetic energy (both linear and rotational). The total energy of the system (sphere + Earth) remains constant if we ignore friction. The sphere experiences both linear motion (translation down the plane) and rotational motion (spinning). The rotational motion is governed by the sphere's moment of inertia (resistance to rotational acceleration). The total kinetic energy of the rolling sphere is the sum of its linear kinetic energy (due to its translational motion) and rotational kinetic energy (due to its spin). The ratio of these two forms of kinetic energy depends on the sphere's mass distribution. The sphere's acceleration down the incline is a consequence of the component of gravity acting parallel to the plane. This acceleration is less than g (free fall acceleration) and depends on the angle of the incline.
