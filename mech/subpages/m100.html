       This is a bicycle wheel with a load at the hub and the effort at the circumference. Masses are loaded onto a string wound around a piece of wood at the hub of the wheel. As the masses fall, the wheel is rotated so that the circumference rotates very quickly. When the masses reach the ground, enough rotational energy is stored in the wheel to wind the string up the other way and lift the masses again. The wheel can continue to oscillate in this way for a while.
