      <p class="description">
       A rocket is hung from a retort stand by a piece of string and a block is placed in front of the rocket. The rocket is raised and released, sending it flying into the block. If the rocket has a rubber nosecone, the collision is elastic and the block is knocked over. If a needle is screwed into the nosecone, the collision is inelastic (because energy goes into deforming the block at the point of impact) and the block is not knocked over.
