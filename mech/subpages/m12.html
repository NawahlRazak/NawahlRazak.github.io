        An electromagnet is suspended from a tall stand and attached to a
        special switch box designed for the experiment. A metal plate (serving
        as the target) is held by the magnetic field of the electromagnet. The
        gun is set up and aimed directly at the centre of the target. A
        ball-bearing (serving as the bullet) is shot by blowing into a rubber
        tube attached to the lower end of the gun. As the bullet leaves the gun,
        the electromagnet is switched off, causing the target to drop. The
        bullet should hit the target, regardless of the speed at which it leaves
        the gun. The speed of the bullet can be varied by blowing more or less
        vigorously into the rubber tube. Note that the apparatus takes time to
        adjust and test.
