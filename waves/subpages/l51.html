           Polarisation by transmission through a pile of plates. Two wooden boxes, each containing a pile of plates, mounted “at Brewster’s angle.” Hold them in beam from Leitz projector, or other projector. When held so that plates are parallel, beam is transmitted; If one pile is rotated 90deg about axis, beam is extinguished. Or use on pile and a Polaroid sheet – this is easier. (Transmitted light is rather dim and greenish, owing to poor quality of the glass used. Should be replaced by clearer glass.)
