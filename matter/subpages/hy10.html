      <p class="description">
        Buoys are designed to float due to their shape and the materials they are made from, which are typically lighter than water. 
        They displace a volume of water equal to their own weight, creating an upward buoyant force that counteracts gravity. 
        This principle allows them to stay afloat on the water's surface.
