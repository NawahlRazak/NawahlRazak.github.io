      <p class="description">
            This shows the effect of eddy currents induced in such a direction as to oppose the motion, tending to change the flux of induction. A copper plate swings between the poles of a strong horseshoe permanent magnet. The braking effect brings the plate to rest after about one swing. When the plate is replaced by one with similar contour but with slots cut into it, the latter swings relatively freely for some time. A smaller demo also exists.
