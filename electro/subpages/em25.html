        Charge the brass sphere by rubbing or flicking it with flannel (or rubbing it with rabbit skin). Bring it near to the hollow brass sphere connected to a gold leaf electroscope. The leaves diverge. Touch the hollow sphere (or the upper plate of the electroscope) momentarily. The leaves collapse, as there is now no potential difference between them and the earthed case (but there is still a positive charge on both of them.) Remove the solid sphere. The leaves diverge, because the net positive charge of whole system raises it above earth.
