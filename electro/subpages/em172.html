            Operate by ionizing the gas with an applied voltage sufficient to cause electrical conduction by the underlying phenomena of the Townsend discharge. a) Two sealed evacuated tube mounted on vertical board. Attached to large induction coil, with 12V battery connected to primary. b) A third tube with tap, which can be evacuated while attached to secondary of induction coil. Use vacuum pump V.
