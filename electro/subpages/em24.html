         Use the tapered brass cone that has one end pointed and the other, large end, rounded. Charge it by flicking it with flannel (or rubbing it with rabbit skin). Use a proof plane to remove charge from one end or the other, and transfer it to a gold leaf electroscope. Show that the charges are more concentrated at the pointed end. A small wooden cone on a stand can also be used for this demonstration.
