           A large Jacobâ€™s ladder can be found on the table. The accompanying transformer is in a cupboard underneath the circuit boards. Plug the transformer into the AC mains and watch a spark climb up the ladder. Check that the two sides of the ladder are reasonably close together otherwise the spark stops before it reaches the top. It is also possible to use the demonstration transformer core for EM126, but with a secondary coil. There are special holes for the two metal sticks that form the ladder. Show that sparks run up the ladder when it is vertical (conventional), but that they stick in place if the transformer is turned on its side so that the ladder is horizontal.
