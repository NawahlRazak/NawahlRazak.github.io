            This requires two identical coils. (Various demonstrations with different shaped pairs of coils exist.) The primary coil is connected to a 12V battery or rectified power supply. The secondary is connected to a galvanometer. The galvanometer deflects when current in the primary is switched on or off (opposite direction kicks) or reversed. Deflections are also seen when the coils are brought nearer together or brought further apart or when a bar magnet is brought up to or taken away from the secondary; but only while the change is actually occurring. In some of the coil pairs, the power can be varied. This also induces current in the secondary coil.
