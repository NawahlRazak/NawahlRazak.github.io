      <p class="description">
         It was invented by William Thomson, the First Baron Kelvin, in the late 19th century. The Kelvin balance works by measuring the force of attraction or repulsion between two coils of wire carrying an electric current. This force is then balanced by adding known weights to a beam balance, allowing for the accurate determination of the current.
