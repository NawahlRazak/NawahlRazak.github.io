         The capacitor consists of six 6-microfarad condensers mounted on a wooden board and connected in parallel. V = 160V from the isolation transformer tapping. Both removable cores from the demonstration transformers are needed. Push them through the coil. At resonance the large light bulb in series with the LC loop goes out (showing that the circuit as a whole has impedance tending to infinity) while the small light bulb in the LC loop glows brightly, showing that within this loop a relatively large current is circulating.
