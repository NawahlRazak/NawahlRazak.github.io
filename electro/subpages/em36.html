         There are two boxes. One contains rods of the following: glass, Perspex, ebonite and Teflon. The other contains silk cloth (with holes in it) and a rabbit skin. A stand for supporting the rods, some watch glasses and pieces of Perspex are also in this second box. Rub glass or Perspex with silk to give it a positive charge. Rub ebonite or Teflon with the rabbit skin to give it a negative charge. Place one rod on an inverted watch glass, and use another rod to attract or repel it depending on the signs of the charges involved.
