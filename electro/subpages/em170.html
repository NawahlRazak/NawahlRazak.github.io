           a) There is a tube containing a Maltese cross so that electrons cast its shadow on a fluorescent screen. Connect it to a large induction coil with a 12V battery in the primary circuit. See EM152 b) There is also an evacuated tube with a "paddle wheel" that is able to roll along glass rails when it is propelled by an electron beam from the cathode. Connect it to a large induction coil.
