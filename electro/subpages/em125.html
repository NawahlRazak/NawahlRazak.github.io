           Two parallel wires are loosely strung on a wooden frame and lying close together. Use the accompanying board to set up the circuit through a 12V battery. Show that when current flows in the same direction they attract and jump together. When current flows in opposite directions the wires repel. (This effect is weaker as separation becomes greater.) Current may also be passed through two wires at right angles but no effect is observed. Do not press the tapping key for longer than a second or two.
